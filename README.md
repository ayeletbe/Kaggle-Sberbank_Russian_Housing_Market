The aim is to predict the sale price of each property. The target variable is called price_doc in train.csv.

Evaluation:

Submissions are evaluated on the RMSLE between their predicted prices and the actual data. The target variable, called price_doc in the training set, is the sale price of each property.

The training data is from August 2011 to June 2015, and the test set is from July 2015 to May 2016. 
The dataset also includes information about overall conditions in Russia's economy and finance sector, so you can focus on generating accurate price forecasts for individual properties, without needing to second-guess what the business cycle will do.
